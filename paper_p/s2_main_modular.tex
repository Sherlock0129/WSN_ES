\begin{abstract}
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) face fundamental challenges in simultaneously prolonging network lifetime and balancing energy distribution due to the decoupling of information and energy systems. Traditional approaches optimize within fixed system constraints, making it difficult to achieve both objectives simultaneously. This paper proposes an Information-Energy Dual System that integrates four synergistic mechanisms: (1) Age-of-Energy-Information (AOEI) priority mechanism that determines energy information reporting timing through dynamic AOI thresholds; (2) InfoNode digital twin mechanism that maintains virtual node energy tables through theoretical energy calculations; (3) Adaptive Lyapunov Duration Planning (ALDP) mechanism that performs prospective transmission duration planning; and (4) Energy-Efficient Transfer Opportunistic Routing (EETOR) mechanism that opportunistically collects node information during energy transmission. These four mechanisms work synergistically to fundamentally integrate information and energy systems, solving the core problem of "information system independence from energy system." Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly prolongs network lifetime (first node death time) and improves energy balance (coefficient of variation) without increasing total energy consumption, achieving a 194.4\% improvement in the combined objective compared to baseline methods.
